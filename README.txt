# Summary

The Cantonese UD treebank was manually annotated by Tak-sum Wong and Herman H. M. Leung at City University of Hong Kong, by finely transcribing a film shooted by students from the School of Creative Media. The data is in Tradiaitonal Chinese.

POS TAGGING

When determining the POS, one usually considers both the "morphological evidence", i.e., the linguistic form of the word, as well as the "distributional evidence", i.e., its syntactic use in the sentence. Usually, these two kinds of evidence should agree; in some cases, however, the POS of some word is tentatively alterned to fullfil the special purpose of the author.

Take an example in English, consider the word "pen" in the sentence "I pen a letter".  Morphological evidence suggests the word "pen" should be tagged as an noun (NN), reflecting its normal usage. Distributional evidence suggests it should be tagged as a verb, since this word is in a typical syntactic position of verb in a SVO language.

When these two kinds of evidence contradict one another, the morphological evidence prevails.
